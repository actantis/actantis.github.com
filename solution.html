<h2>Solution Manifesto</h2>

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>Actantis "ækt-'ənt-ɪs" - inspired by ‘actor-network’ theory where 'actants' as integral structural elements of the<br >
ecosystem (people, systems, data, etc) converge into one entity able to create value through this aggregation.</p> 

<h3>Summary</h3>
</p>Unified Transportation Platform for Dynamic Personal Travel Routing and Predictive Transport Data Analytics.</p>

<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Enable passengers and transport firms to unlock the full power of massive amount of computational power and<br >
public transport data, all in unified and real-time way through advanced analytics, automation and optimisation.</p>

<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Connectivity and convergence for better transportation and intelligent mobility to simplify personal travel, reduce<br >
travel unpredictability and improve disruption recovery through advanced analytics, automation and optimisation.</p>

<h3>Slogan</h3>
<p>'Travel Time Matters' – spend more time doing interesting stuff that matters and less time worrying about travel.<br >
'Travel Less. Live More' – free personal time from travel planning, transport monitoring and disruption avoidance.<br >
'Science for Better' – outsource decision-making of individual journey routing to automatic optimisation machine.<br >
'Time of Knowing' – know better transport situation affecting individual journeys and expected arrival in real-time.<br >
'Travel Connections' – empower passengers and transport companies working together to reduce travel disruption.</p>

<h3>Values</h3>
<p>01. Free Time – spend more time doing interesting stuff that matters and less time worrying about travel time.<br >
02. Peace of Mind – off-load transport tracking to personal travel assistant and get informed when on route.<br >
03. On-time Anytime – leave decision-making to optimisation engine services and get better travel experience.<br >
04. Adaptive Service – dynamically assemble algorithms and orchestrate microservices based on personal needs.<br >
05. Reduce Unpredictability – crowdsource travel data to aggregate and enhance predictive analytics for clients.<br > 

<h3>Products</h3>
<p>01. Stable – resilience, recoverability and reusability of algorithms, services and solutions for high performance.<br >
02. Secure – resistance to and protection from threats and damage to reduce risks by building defence in depth.<br >
03. Scalable – capability to handle a growing amount of work or potentials to be enlarged to accommodate growth.<br >
04. Sustainable – capacity to create bearable, viable, equitable experience for economy, society and environment.<br >
05. Simple – reasonably easy and clear to understand, explain and implement products, services and processes.<br >

<h3>Services</h3>
<p>01. Agile – quick, smart and acute in understanding needs, having the capacity for intelligent transformation.<br >
02. Accurate – consistent with a standard, rule or model, having the capability to providing correct measurement.<br >
03. Adaptable – able to adjust itself readily to different situations and changing conditions based on personal need.<br >
04. Accessible – easily obtained, understood and appreciated to be frequently used for daily personal consumption.<br >
05. Automate – convert mundane, repetitive, routine task into automatic operations, calculations and optimisation.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>01. Connect – public transport companies and passengers, working together to reduce service disruptions.<br >
02. Crowdsource – passengers travel paths, usage patters and behaviour for expected demand and overload.<br >
03. Converge – cloud services, users, data, social, mobile and Internet of Things for better service delivery.<br >
04. Compute – advanced mathematical methods, models and algorithms for computational processing power.<br >
05. Communicate – unique insights of passengers flow and transport usage patterns for better travel experience.</p>

<h3>Capability</h3>
<p></p>01. Connect & Monitor – adaptive mobile app and microservices with real-time alerting and travel route monitoring.<br >
02. Track & Describe – individual journey tracking via gathering data of personal routes, experience and disruptions.<br >
03. Insight & Predict – avoid public transport disruptions and better estimate of expected arrival time to destination.<br >
04. Optimise & Prescribe – dynamic route optimisation to save time, money and effort, and simplify daily commute.<br >
05. Analyse & Visualise – derive value for better passengers flow, disruption management and demand estimation.</p>
